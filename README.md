Behold, the glory of an annotated digital edition created before I knew about digital editions (or TEI, or digital humanities, or...) 

I... would not recommend a similar 70s-basement color scheme or encrusted HTML for text encoding, but wanted to make this perusable by others nevertheless. Think I started work on this in 2005, but was using a university URL until around 2009.

This is a very early project of mine, attempting to make the text of Ulysses publicly enjoyable/accessible and also play around with annotation and filtering display of annotations to user needs.
