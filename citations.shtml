<h1>Resources Used to Create the Text Annotations</h1>
</p>
<p>
The annotations to the text shown here are derived from a variety of sources. As
I am currently in my fifth reading of <em>Ulysses</em> after first reading it 
nearly six years ago, correct attribution of the source for every interpretation
I have heard along the way is, unfortunately, impossible; however, every effort
has been made to attribute sources when this is possible.
</p>
<p>
When annotations were drawn straight from my own knowledge of the book, no
citation is given. Much of my early understanding of Joyce's text was shaped by
Harry Blamires's <em>The New Bloomsday Book</em>, which accompanied my first 
reading of the novel and I have cited here whenever (a) I returned to it
for assistance or (b) I recall a specific interpretation coming from that book.
</p>
<p>
Richard Ellmann's biography <em>James Joyce</em> was also invaluable to my understanding
of where Joyce was coming from with all this paranoia about "usurpers"
and "tempters"; indeed, Joyce's need to distance himself from the artistic
constraints of ireland led him to spend most of his life away from his homeland.
It also allows one to trace interesting parallels between Joyce's and Stephen's lives
(e.g. the incident where Stephen feels he has been kicked out of the tower, and
Mulligan, who was based on Joyce's erstwhile friend Oliver Gogarty).
</p>
<p>
Other resources are cited at the end of the annotations to which they apply;
these refer to full references given at the bottom of each episodes's
Briefing page (the pages which precede each episode, giving an overview of 
what is in store). I also list here all resources used to create annotations for 
the text:

<h1>Resources Used to Find the Site's Images</h1>
</p>
<p>
Wherever possible, images from the public domain were used. All images not clearly from the public domain
(and most that are as well)
contain a link to their host page in the "alt" value of their image tag (use View -> Page Source on your browser to see these).
However, many of these images are historical and thus not the property of the sites on which they appear,
so in many cases links are intended more as a courtesy than as an attribution to a creator.
