<p> &mdash;You, <a href=''#''>Cochrane<span>one of Stephen's students</span></a>, <a href=''#''>what
city<span>Stephen is in the middle of quizzing the boys on ancient history, specifically a battle of
the Greek Pyrrhus.</span></a> sent for him? </p> <p> &mdash;Tarentum, sir. </p> <p>

&mdash;Very good. Well? </p> <p> &mdash;There was a battle, sir. </p> <p> &mdash;Very good. Where?
</p> <p> The boy's blank face asked the blank window. </p> <p> Fabled by the daughters of memory.
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of <a
href=''#''>Blake's wings of excess.<span>A compound of two of William Blake's proverbs: ''The road
of excess leads to the palace of wisdom'' and ''No bird soars too high, if he soars with his own
wings'' (Gifford & Seidman 30)</span></a> <a href=''#''>I hear the ruin of all space<span>Stephen
combines the idea of the ruin of Troy (referenced by both Pyrrhus's failure to save Greece from the
Romans, and Mr. Deasy's later reference to Cassandra) with the Blakean concept of the world ending
'''consumed by fire'... 'the ruins of Time build mansions in Eternity''' (Gifford & Seidman
30)</span></a>, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame. What's left us
then? </p> <p> &mdash;I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C. </p>

<p><div class="historical"> &mdash;<a href=''#''>Asculum<span>the site of Pyrrhus's ultimately
disastrous (to Pyrrhus's cause) victory over the Romans</span></a>, Stephen said, glancing at the
name and date in the gorescarred book.</div> </p> <p> &mdash;Yes, sir. And he said: <em>Another
victory like that and we are done for.</em> </p> <p> <a href=''#''>That phrase the world had
remembered<span>''Another victory like that and we are done for''; Stephen imagines the sentence
being spoken.</span></a>. A dull ease of the mind. From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general
speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear. </p>
<p><div class="historical"> &mdash;You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of <a
href=''#''>Pyrrhus<span>''another hero who suffered from usurpation'', Pyrrhus failed to save the
Greek people from bondage to Rome (Blamires 10); his example echoes the present-day plight of both
the jews and the Irish. The term ''Pyrrhic victory'' is named after him, as many of his battles were
won only through heavy losses that were ultimately disastrous (''Another victory like that and we
are done for''). Image from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Arta-Pyrrhus.jpg<br><center><img src="images/nestor/pyrrhus.jpg"
alt="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Arta-Pyrrhus.jpg"></center></span></a>?</div> </p> <p>
&mdash;End of Pyrrhus, sir? </p>

<p> &mdash;I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said. </p> <p> &mdash;Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know
anything about Pyrrhus? </p> <p><div class="vocab"> A bag of <a href=''#''>figrolls<span>sweet
pastry containing figs. Image from http://www.inklingmagazine.com/images/article-images/fig_rolls.jpg<br><center><img src="images/nestor/figrolls.jpg"

snugly in Armstrong's satchel. He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy's breath. Welloff people, proud that their
eldest son was in the navy. Vico road, Dalkey.</div> </p> <p><div class="historical">
&mdash;Pyrrhus, sir? <a href=''#''>Pyrrhus, a pier<span>Armstrong, not knowing the answer, jokes by
declining the word as if it were a Latin noun.</span></a>.</div> </p> <p> All laughed. Mirthless
high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a
moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay. </p>
<p><div class="vocab"> &mdash;Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book,
what is a <a href=''#''>pier?<span>a dock or other walkway extending into water upon
supports. Image from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clevedon_Victorian_pier.jpg<br><center><img src="images/nestor/pier.jpg"
alt="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clevedon_Victorian_pier.jpg"></center></span></a></div>

</p> <p><div class="default"> &mdash;A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind
of a bridge. <a href=''#''>Kingstown pier<span>From the boys' laughter, obviously a popular place
for spooning with girls. Image from http://www.joyceimages.com/media/ji/Kingstown%20CoDublin.JPG<br><center><img src="images/nestor/kingstown.JPG"
alt="http://www.joyceimages.com/media/ji/Kingstown%20CoDublin.JPG"></center></span></a>, sir.
</div></p> <p> Some laughed again: <a href=''#''>mirthless but with meaning<span>though they might
not enjoy the joke, the boys do enjoy being able to laugh condescendingly at their
teacher</span></a>. Two in the back bench whispered. Yes. <a href=''#''>They knew<span>The boys,
despite their relative youth, have all had or know about sexual encounters. </span></a>: had never
learned nor ever been innocent. All. With envy he watched their faces: <a href=''#''>Edith, Ethel,
Gerty, Lily<span>Girls the boys know; Gerty is possibly the Gerty who narrates the ''Nausicaa''
episode later in the book. </span></a>. Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam,
their bracelets tittering in the struggle. </p> <p> &mdash;Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, <a
href=''#''>a disappointed bridge<span>Disappointed in that it doesn't cross any water.</span></a>.
</p> <p> The words troubled their gaze. </p> <p> &mdash;How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a
river. </p> <p>

<a href=''#''>For Haines's chapbook<span>Stephen remarks that his joke on Kingstown Pier would
probably please Haines enough to record, as with his earlier words on the cracked mirror as ''the
symbol of Irish art''.</span></a>. <a href=''#''>No-one here to hear<span>Stephen considers that
since no one who heard his joke was able to appreciate it, he should save it for a witticism during
tonight's drinking with Mulligan and Haines.</span></a>. Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to
pierce the polished mail of his mind. <a href=''#''>What then?<span>Repeating his witticism for
Haines and Mulligan would only make Stephen into a jester or servant, offering up his mind in return
for a little laughter.</span></a> A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed,
winning a clement master's praise. <a href=''#''>Why had they chosen all that part?<span>Stephen
feels that all the Irish have taken on the role of jesters or servants to others, perhaps because
their land had been so long run under by foreign people.</span></a> Not wholly for the smooth
caress. For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop. </p>
<p><div class="vocab"> <a href=''#''>Had Pyrrhus not fallen<span>Stephen wonders what would have
happened if significant moments history had ended differently. Had Pyrrhus not fallen, Greece might
have remained a free country.</span></a> by a <a href=''#''>beldam's<span>a hag</span></a> hand in
Argos or Julius Caesar not been</div>knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has
branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the <a href=''#''>infinite
possibilities<span>all the other events in history that didn't occur because another event did;
Stephen wonders if it's even worth thinking of these alternate realities as existing, since they
never came to pass.</span></a> they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing that they
never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? <a href=''#''>Weave, weaver of the
wind<span>dreaming about alternate histories and what could have been instead of focusing on what
did happen is foolish</span></a>. </p> <p> &mdash;Tell us a story, sir. </p> <p> &mdash;O, do, sir.
A ghoststory. </p> <p> &mdash;<a href=''#''>Where do you begin in this?<span>Stephen ignores the
students' request and moves on to their recitation lesson, asking for the line the students were
supposed to begin from</span></a> Stephen asked, opening another book. </p> <p> -<em>-Weep no
more,</em> Comyn said.

</p> <p> &mdash;Go on then, Talbot. </p> <p> &mdash;And the story, sir? </p> <p> &mdash;After,
Stephen said. Go on, Talbot. </p> <p><div class="vocab"> A <a href=''#''>swarthy<span>having dark,
olive-toned skin</span></a> boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the <a
href=''#''>breastwork<span>fortification</span></a> of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with
odd glances at the text:</div> </p> <p> <br> <em>&mdash;Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no
more<br> For </em><a href=''#''><em>Lycidas</em><span>a Milton poem</span></a><em>, your sorrow, is
not dead,<br> Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor...</em><br> <br> </p> <p> <a href=''#''>It
must be a movement then<span>From Aristotle: '''The fulfillment of what exists potentially, in so
far as it exists potentially, is motion...'' (Gifford & Seidman 32)</span></a>, an actuality of the
possible as possible. Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the <a href=''#''>gabbled
verses<span>the sound of the students messing up their recitations</span></a> and floated out into
the <a href=''#''>studious silence<span>Stephen remembers his recent studies in Paris; he was called
home from these by the nearing death of his mother</span></a> of the library of Saint Genevieve
where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a delicate Siamese
conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with
faintly beating feelers: and in my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of
brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. <a href=''#''>Thought is the thought of
thought<span>playing on two phrases from Aristotle: ''thought of thought'' and ''form of forms''
(Blamires 11); ''In <em>Metaphysics</em>, Aristotle argues that the prime mover is thought thinking
on itself'' (Gifford & Seidman 32)</span></a>. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that
is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, <a href=''#''>candescent<span>glowing
(incandescent)</span></a>: form of forms. </p> <p> Talbot repeated: </p> <p> <br> <em>&mdash;Through
the dear might of Him that walked the waves,<br> Through the dear might...</em> <br> </p> <p>
&mdash;<a href=''#''>Turn over<span>Stephen knows the boy is sneaking glances at the text he was
supposed to have memorized, and allows him to turn the page when he needs to; the boy pretends to
not know what Stephen is talking about</span></a>, Stephen said quietly. I don't see anything. </p>
<p> &mdash;What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.

</p> <p> His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered. Of
him that walked the waves. Here also over these craven hearts <a href=''#''>his shadow<span>the
shadow of Jesus, who is ''him who walked the waves'' (walked on water)</span></a> lies and on the
scoffer's heart and lips and on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the
tribute. <a href=''#''>To Caesar what is Caesar's<span>"Render unto Caesar the things which are
Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's" (Matthew 22:21), Jesus's recommended method for
dealing with secular and divine authorities</span></a>, to God what is God's. A long look from dark
eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church's looms. Ay. </p> <p> <br> <a
href=''#''><em>Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.<br> My father gave me seeds to sow</em><span>part of
a riddle much like our modern ''What's white and black and read all over?''; it continues, '''The
seed was black and the ground was white / Riddle me that and I'll give you a pipe''', the answer
being ''writing a letter'' (Gifford & Seidman 32-33)</span></a>. <br> </p> <p> Talbot slid his
closed book into his satchel. </p> <p> &mdash;Have I heard all? Stephen asked. </p> <p><div
class="historical"> &mdash;Yes, sir. <a href=''#''>Hockey<span> field hockey -- not the ice
type</span></a> at ten, sir. </div> </p> <p> &mdash;Half day, sir. Thursday. </p> <p> &mdash;Who can
answer a riddle? Stephen asked. </p> <p> They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages
rustling. Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily: </p> <p>
&mdash;A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir. </p> <p> &mdash;O, ask me, sir. </p> <p>

&mdash;A hard one, sir. </p> <p> &mdash;This is the riddle, Stephen said: </p> <p> <br> <a
href=''#''><em>The cock crew,<br> The sky was blue:<br> The bells in heaven<br> Were striking
eleven.<br> 'Tis time for this poor soul<br> To go to heaven</em><span>Stephen's riddle pokes fun at
his students: ''it is unanswerable unless the answer is already known'' (Gifford & Seidman
33)</span></a>.</em> <br> </p> <p> What is that? </p> <p> &mdash;What, sir? </p> <p>

&mdash;Again, sir. We didn't hear. </p> <p> Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After
a silence Cochrane said: </p> <p> &mdash;What is it, sir? We give it up. </p> <p> Stephen, his
throat itching, answered: </p> <p> &mdash;<a href=''#''>The fox burying his grandmother under a
hollybush<span>Stephen's riddle pokes fun at his students: ''it is unanswerable unless the answer is
already known'' (Gifford & Seidman 33). Note the fox imagery references Stephen, who is cunning like
a fox and has also recently buried his mother (not quite grandmother, as in the riddle).</span></a>.
</p> <p> He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay. </p>

<p> A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: </p> <p> &mdash;Hockey! </p> <p>
They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly they were gone and from the
lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues. </p> <p> Sargent who
alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook. His thick hair and scraggy neck
gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his
cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail's bed.
</p> <p> He held out his copybook. The word <em>Sums</em> was written on the headline. Beneath were
sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his
name and seal.

</p> <p> &mdash;Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.
</p> <p> Stephen touched the edges of the book. <a href=''#''>Futility<span>Stephen recognizes the
futility of the weak student's attempt to learn.</span></a>. </p> <p> &mdash;Do you understand how
to do them now? he asked. </p> <p> &mdash;Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said
I was to copy them off the board, sir. </p> <p> &mdash;Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked. </p>
<p>

&mdash;No, sir. </p> <p> Ugly and futile: lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink, a snail's
bed. <a href=''#''>Yet someone had loved him<span>Stephen muses on the wonder of the love of mothers
for their children, even children as weak and ill-favored as Sargent, as ''the only true thing in
life''; he obviously has an uneasiness over his relationship to his deceased mother, whose last wish
he slighted in order to feel free.</span></a>, borne him in her arms and in her heart. But for her
the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved
his weak watery blood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in life? His
mother's prostrate body the fiery<div class="historical"> <a href=''#''>Columbanus<span>Saint
Columbanus, like Pyrrhus, was another fighter who failed to save a country; he left Ireland for
Europe to advocate for the Irish Church (Blamires 11)</span></a> in holy zeal bestrode. She was no
more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She
had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul gone to
heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless
bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and
scraped.</div> </p> <p> Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. <a href=''#''>He proves
by algebra that Shakespeare's ghost is Hamlet's grandfather<span>echo of Mulligan's early
explanation of Stephen's Hamlet paradox</span></a>. Sargent peered askance through his slanted
glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the
field. </p> <p><div class="vocab"> Across the page the symbols moved in grave <a
href=''#''>morrice<span>like ''morris'', a medieval, slow country dance remotely like American
square dancing. Image from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Morris_dancers_Thames_at_Richmond.jpg<br><center><img src="images/nestor/morris.jpg"

obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not
comprehend.</div> </p> <p> &mdash;Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself? </p>
<p> &mdash;Yes, sir. </p>

<p><div class="vocab"> In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word of
help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull
skin. <em><a href=''#''>Amor matris:</em> subjective and objective genitive<span>''amor matris'' is
Latin for ''a mother's love''; subjective and objective genitive are the declensions of the Latin
nouns (declensions are to nouns sort of what conjugations are to verbs; the declension of a noun
indicates how it is being used in a sentence)</span></a>. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she
had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.</div> </p> <p> Like him was I, these
sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My childhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand
there once or lightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony sit in the
dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.
</p> <p> The sum was done. </p> <p> &mdash;It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up. </p> <p>
&mdash;Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.

</p> <p> He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his
bench. </p> <p> &mdash;You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he
followed towards the door the boy's graceless form. </p> <p> &mdash;Yes, sir. </p> <p> In the
corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield. </p> <p> &mdash;Sargent! </p> <p>

&mdash;Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you. </p> <p><div class="vocab"> He stood in the
porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife.
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with <a

shins, from mud. Images from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HalfChaps2.jpg<br><center><img src="images/nestor/gaiters.jpg"

reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He turned his angry white
moustache.</div> </p> <p> &mdash;What is it now? he cried continually without listening. </p> <p>
&mdash;Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said. </p> <p> &mdash;Will you wait
in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here. </p> <p> And as he stepped
fussily back across the field his old man's voice cried sternly: </p>

<p> &mdash;What is the matter? What is it now? </p> <p> Their sharp voices cried about him on all
sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed
head. </p> <p><div class="historical"> Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab
abraded leather of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. As it was in the
beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of <a href=''#''>Stuart coins<span>Stuart refers to the
family that ruled England during the 1600s. Despite the Stuart's Catholicism and Irish ancestry, the

the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.
</p> <p> &mdash;First, our little financial settlement, he said. </p> <p> He brought out of his coat
a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined
halves, and laid them carefully on the table.

</p> <p> &mdash;Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away. </p> <p><div class="vocab">
And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen's embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the

Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his
trousers. </p> <p> &mdash;No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it. </p> <p> Stephen's
hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too of beauty and of power. A lump in my
pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery. </p> <p> &mdash;Don't carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.
You'll pull it out somewhere and lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You'll find them very
handy. </p> <p> Answer something. </p>

<p> &mdash;Mine would be often empty, Stephen said. </p> <p> The same room and hour, the same
wisdom: and I the same. Three times now. <a href=''#''>Three nooses<span>again, Stephen is conscious
of being a servant; the three nooses are the three times he has accepted money for his work as a
teacher</span></a> round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant if I will. </p> <p>
&mdash;Because you don't save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don't know yet what money is.
Money is power. When you have lived as long as I have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what
does Shakespeare say? <em>Put but money in thy purse.</em> </p> <p><div class="default"> &mdash;<a

makes him not a mentor, like his Odysseyan counterpart Nestor, but another usurper; like Mulligan

murmured. </div></p> <p> He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man's stare. </p>

<p> &mdash;He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but an Englishman too.

hear from an Englishman's mouth? </p> <p> <a href=''#''>The seas' ruler<span>an epithet used earlier

&mdash;That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets. </p> <p> &mdash;Ba! Mr Deasy cried.
That's not English. A French Celt said that. He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail. </p>
<p> &mdash;I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. <em>I paid my way.</em>
</p>

<p> <a href=''#''>Good man, good man<span>Stephen ironically mentally congratulates Deasy's choice

all his debts (it is interesting that he lists himself as indebted to Mulligan, although Stephen has
paid the rent for their tower and given Mulligan drinking money)</span></a>. <a href=''#''>The

no, Stephen answered. </p>

<p> Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox. </p> <p> &mdash;I knew you
couldn't, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it. We are a generous people but we must also
be just. </p> <p> &mdash;I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy. </p>

In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are the signs of a nation's decay.
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation's vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As
sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction. Old England
is dying. </p>

<p> He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam. He faced
about and back again. </p> <p> &mdash;Dying, he said again, if not dead by now. </p> <p> <br> <a

&mdash;<a href=''#''>A merchant<span>Stephen gently suggests that the hatred of unscrupulous

<p> &mdash;<a href=''#''>They sinned against the light<span>some Christians continued to blame
modern Jews for the execution of Jesus</span></a>, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see the
darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day. </p> <p> On the
steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble
of geese. They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit
silk hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full slow eyes belied the
words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their
zeal was vain. Vain patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard heaped by the
roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the
dishonours of their flesh. </p> <p> &mdash;<a href=''#''>Who has not?<span>i.e. Who has not sinned
in some way?</span></a> Stephen said. </p> <p> &mdash;What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked. </p> <p> He
came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly. Is this old
wisdom? He waits to hear from me. </p> <p> &mdash;History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I
am trying to awake.

</p> <p> From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal. What if that
nightmare gave you a back kick? </p> <p> &mdash;The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy
said. All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God. </p> <p> Stephen
jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: </p> <p> &mdash;That is God. </p> <p> Hooray! Ay!
Whrrwhee! </p> <p>

&mdash;What? Mr Deasy asked. </p> <p> &mdash;A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his
shoulders. </p> <p> Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between
his fingers. Looking up again he set them free. </p> <p> &mdash;I am happier than you are, he said.
We have committed many errors and many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was
no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on
Troy. A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough's wife and her
leman, O'Rourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many failures but
not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my days. But I will fight for the right till the
end. </p> <p> <br> <em>For Ulster will fight<br> And Ulster will be right.</em> <br> </p> <p>

Stephen raised the sheets in his hand. </p> <p> &mdash;Well, sir, he began... </p> <p> &mdash;I
foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work. You were not born to
be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am wrong. </p> <p> &mdash;A learner rather, Stephen said. </p> <p>
And here what will you learn more? </p> <p> Mr Deasy shook his head. </p>

<p> &mdash;Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great teacher. </p> <p>
Stephen rustled the sheets again. </p> <p> &mdash;As regards these, he began. </p> <p> &mdash;Yes,
Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them published at once. </p> <p> <a
href=''#''><em>Telegraph. Irish Homestead</em><span>two Dublin papers with which Stephen has
connections</span></a>.</em> </p>

<p> &mdash;I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two editors slightly. </p>
<p> &mdash;That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field, M.P. There is a
meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the City Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter
before the meeting. You see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they? </p> <p>
<em>&mdash;The Evening Telegraph...</em> </p> <p> &mdash;That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no
time to lose. Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin. </p> <p> &mdash;Good morning, sir,
Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket. Thank you. </p> <p>

&mdash;Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I like to break a lance with
you, old as I am. </p> <p> &mdash;Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.

hard and swallowing his breath. </p> <p> &mdash;I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say,
has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know that? No. And
do you know why? </p> <p> He frowned sternly on the bright air. </p> <p> &mdash;Why, sir? Stephen
asked, beginning to smile. </p> <p> &mdash;Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.

</p> <p> A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of
phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air. </p> <p>
&mdash;She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet
over the gravel of the path. That's why. </p> <p> On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of
leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins. </p>
