<h1>Episode 1: Debriefing</h1>
<p>
"Telemachus" is not a very difficult episode to comprehend -- unlike later
episodes, it is written in a fairly normal style, with only a few lapses
into stream-of-consciousness.
</p>
<p>
The main thing to understand from this episode is why Stephen is driven to label
Mulligan an "usurper". Even if Mulligan seems likable to <em>you</em>, it's 
important to understand why Stephen feels their friendship is at an end.
</p>
<p>
If this isn't clear to you, consider the following:
<ul>
<li>The crossed razor and mirror which Mulligan offers up as a sacrifice at the
beginning of his mock mass are later identified by Stephen as the symbol of
Irish art (and Stephen is an Irish artist).</li>
<li>Mulligan acts offended when Stephen facetiously asks Haines if he can make
any money off his sayings, but had previously hypocritically offered up Stephen's
witticism to Haines himself, after counseling Stephen to tell Haines and then
"touch him" for some money.</li>
<li>Mulligan has introduced an Englishman into their home (albeit a nice one),
and then asks for the key from Stephen -- though it is Stephen who pays the rent.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h1>Connections to the Next Episode</h1>
The next two episodes also follow Stephen's thoughts; these will help you get a better
grasp on his attitude toward Mulligan. Episode 2 ("Nestor") sees 
Stephen at his "school kip", teaching boys who do not respect him
and picking up his wages from his British master.
