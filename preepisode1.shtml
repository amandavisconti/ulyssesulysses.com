<h1>Episode 1: Briefing</h1>
</p>
<p>
The first episode of <em>Ulysses</em> is usually referred to as "Telemachus".
Joyce parallels the books of the <em>Odyssey</em> with the episodes of his 
novel; as the first book of the Odyssey introduces us to Telemachus, the hero's 
son, so this episode introduces Stephen Dedalus, who will become a son figure to
protagonist Leopold Bloom.<br>
<span class="right"><img src="images/telemachus/roof.jpg" width="350" height="262" alt="http://www.joyceimages.com/media/ji/%5BMartello%20Roof%5D.JPG"></span>
You will notice references to the Odyssey throughout <em>Ulysses</em>, as well 
as references to <em>Hamlet</em> and the Christian trinity. These stories all
portray father-son relationships that are evoked as protagonists Leopold Bloom
and Stephen Dedalus find their lives intertwined in a father-son relationship.
</p>

<p>
<span class="highlight">A Brief Episode Synopsis</span><br>
The book begins at daybreak on the roof of the tower rented by Stephen Dedalus
and Malachi ("Buck") Mulligan. While Mulligan makes his morning shave into a
mockery of the mass, he converses with Stephen. Stephen is in mourning attire
for his recently deceased mother, whose death brought him back from his studies 
in Paris. Mulligan reveals that Stephen, a recent apostate from Catholicism,
refused to honor his mother's dying wish that he kneel down and pray by her
deathbed.<br>
The two go down into the tower for breakfast, where they are joined by their
English boarder Haines, and (briefly) by an Irish milkwoman. After the meal,
the three head off toward Dublin Bay. Stephen discusses teh Irish attitude
toward the British with Haines, while Mulligan sings a blasphemous song about
Jesus and begins his swim, after asking Stephen for the tower's key and some
money. The pair have an appointment to meet at a tavern and drink that evening,
but now Stephen must leave for his teaching job. At the end of the episode, 
Stephen mentally labels Mulligan, who has taken his home (by getting the key
for which Stephen has paid the rent) and threatened his integrity (by
encouraging him to sell out his intellect to the English), a usurper.

<p>
<span class="highlight">What to Watch For</span><br>
The first episode affords a much easier read than the later episodes of <em>
Ulysses</em>. The main things to catch from the episode are the mockery of 
Catholicism (and the mass, especially) performed by Mulligan throughout, and
an understanding of Stephen's growing dislike for the seemingly engaging Mulligan,
culminating in Stephen's denouncing at the episode's end.</p><p>
<strong>Mulligan:</strong> <br>One of the book's first challenges is understanding
why Stephen dislikes the engaging and humorous Mulligan so deeply. Stephen's 
affront over a remark Mulligan made concerning May Dedalus's death is not the 
root of the problem. Watch how Mulligan's humor mocks Stephen's religious
past (Stephen had been an extremely devout Catholic until a few years beforehand);
he is also much to ready to sell himself out -- or Stephen and Stephen's witticisms, 
for that matter -- and Stephen, who broke the hold that church and country had 
over him to become an untethered, free-willed artist by the end of Joyce's
<em>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>, is especially sensitive to
the idea of serving others. In fact, he has thrown off friends for offenses 
similar to Mulligan's before (see note on Cranly in Episode 1).
<br>
Note that while Mulligan is generally well-liked, it will be revealed that three 
of the book's most trustworthy characters do not trust or like him: 
the knife-witted Stephen, Stephen's jovial father Simon (who generally gets on 
well with everyone he meets), and Bloom (who tends to look at the best side of 
every man's character.)</p><p>
<strong>Other Things to Keep In Mind:</strong><br>
The motif of <strong>dark men</strong> and creatures carries throughout the 
novel as a reference to Leopold Bloom. Although Stephen does not actually meet 
Bloom face-to-face until late in the novel, his shadow crosses Stephen's day 
as early as this episode (see note on Haines's leopard dream).<br>
Another motif appearing here is the <strong>drowned man</strong>.

<span class="highlight">Main Characters</span><br>
<strong>Stephen Dedalus:</strong> Stephen, a young, intelligent man with aspirations to be an author.
In mourning for the recent death of his mother, May Dedalus.<br>
<strong>Malachi ("Buck") Mulligan:</strong> Stephen's friend and roommate in the tower. A medical student,
fairly well-off via his aunt (who does not approve of Stephen).<br>
<strong>Haines:</strong> An Englishman from Oxford, in Ireland for academic research. Boarding in
the tower with Mulligan and Stephen.

<p>
<span class="highlight">Setting</span><br>
This episode is set in a former naval defense ("Martello") tower on the Irish 
coast, now rented by Stephen and Mulligan. The tower overlooks Dublin Bay, where
Mulligan goes swimming at the episode's end.
