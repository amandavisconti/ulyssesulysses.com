<p><h1>The Rewards of Reading <em>Ulysses</em></h1></p>
<p>
Given all the challenges, why should anyone try reading Ulysses? Ulysses is a popular 
and respected work for good reason. The novel follows the thoughts of characters 
both humorous and quietly heroic, tinging the commonplace with references to 
life on a grander, Odysseyan scale. The book's subtleties can delight as well as of 
frustrate, keeping the reader alert with puzzles and rewarding him for noticing 
allusions and making connections. If these mental rewards are not enough to 
recommend attempting the book, the novel's frequent ranking near the top of 
lists of the best literature of all time may recommend it to readers 
(see <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html" target="_blank">Modern Library's
List of the 100 Best Novels</a>, which <em>Ulysses</em> tops).
