<h1>General Navigation</h1><br>

To begin, choose an episode from the drop-down menu at the top of the page
(I'd recommend you start with the first chapter!). This will not lead directly to
the episode's text; each episode is preceded by a "briefing" page, which
contains materials such as a synopsis and character descriptions to prep you
for reading the episode.
</p>
<br>
<p>
When you are done reading the briefing page, use the "Episode X" button right
below the site banner and above the text to move to the episode. After you've read the episode,
use the "debriefing" link near the top of the page to move to a page that sums up the episode you've just read. When
<span class="right"><img src="images/navigate.jpg" alt="Screenshot of site navigation" width="600" height="47"></span>
you're ready for a new episode, use the site's main at the very top of the page to pick your chapter.</p>

<h1>Reading the Text: Episode Page Navigation</h1>
<span class="highlight">Toggle the Annotation Links</span><br>
The episode
is set up so that you can scroll through the text of the episode while
notes on the text scroll right alongside. The default setting is for these
notes to include all the notes for the episode, but by using the tabs at the
left of the page, you can limit these notes to one of the areas I identified where you are likelyto have trouble with <em>Ulysses</em>: 
<ul>
<li>Biographical: these notes highlight parts of the text that have biographical parallels with Joyce's life</li>
<li>Historical: These notes contain information that will help you understand slang, historical news, and culture that was
common knowledge during the time <em>Ulysses</em> was set, but may not make sense now.</li>
<li>Vocabulary: Definitions for difficult vocabulary, including Greek, Latin, and French.</li>
<li>Styles: A brief explanation on the style in which the episode is written, according to Joyce's biographer Stuart Gilbert in his scheme of <em>Ulysses</em> (http://www.ulysses-art.demon.co.uk/scheme.html). Each episode is written
in a different style, and as some of them are quite a departure from normal narrative style (e.g. "Aeolus"'s journalistic style) it is important to note the style and consider why Joyce chose to write a given chapter in that way.</li>
<li>Puzzles: There are several puzzles throughout the text, such as the identity of "the man in the Mackintosh"; these
notes help you follow the clues.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<span class="right"><img src="images/telemachus/clock1.jpg" alt="Screenshot of clock example" width="80" height="79"></span>
<span class="highlight">Episode Time</span><br>
Below these tabs is a clock-face. 
The events of <em>Ulysses</em> take place over the course of a single day, from around 8AM through around 3AM the following morning. The clock face
points to the rough time at which the episode you are reading begins.

<span class="highlight">Comments, Questions, and Help</span><br>
<span class="right"><img src="images/help.jpg" alt="Screenshot of help button example" width="102" height="111"></span>
If you have any comments or questions about the episode you're reading, feel free
to send these to me using the "Questions or Comments" button on the right side 
of the page. Also on the right side of the page is a large fuschia "HELP" button,
which you may click on if you're having trouble understanding the site's layout
and wish to read this page again.
