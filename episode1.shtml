probably the style you are most used to with storytelling; notable here is the "young" morning
style, as delivered by the young Stephen Dedalus, as opposed to the "mature" narrative style used
during the description of Bloom's adult habits in the "Calypso" episode, and the "old" narrative
style used in the "Eumaeus" episode at the low point of the day. </span></a></div> </span><br>

<p><div class="default"> <a href="#">S<span><em>Ulysses</em> is divided into three sections, and the
first letter of each appears in large type. The first three episodes (focusing on Stephen Dedalus)
begin with S, the section encompassing the bulk of the novel (focusing on Leopold Bloom) begins with
M, and the last section (three episodes which follow Stephen and Leopold and then relate a monologue
by Molly Bloom) begins with P. "SMP" supposedly refers to the first initials of the three main
characters: Stephen Dedalus, Molly Bloom, and Poldy (Molly's pet name for Leopold). Image from http://spencer.lib.ku.edu/exhibits/bannedbooks/JoyceUlysses2.jpg.

tately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and
a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild
morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned: </p> <p><div class="vocab"> <a
href="#">&mdash;<em>Introibo ad altare Dei</em>.<span>A line spoken by a priest during a Latin
Catholic mass, meaning "I will go to the altar of God". With his morning shave, Mulligan begins a
mockery of the mass that is sustained for much of the episode, complete with blessings and the
shaving bowl as holy incense. This mockery is a subtle taunt to Stephen, who was extremely devout as
a boy; although he realized in adolescence that he could not be both a true artist and serve another
(see Joyce's <em>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> for the story of Stephen's childhood),
Stephen still has more respect for the religion and customs of the "native" Irish (i.e. unAnglicized
and uneducated -- both Mulligan and Stephen are actually native to Ireland) than the opportunistic
Mulligan, who is happy to use his medical training and urban upbringing to ingratiate himself with
Englishmen such as their boarder Haines. Image from http://www.christusrex.org/www2/cantgreg/partituras/co_introibo.gif.<br><center><img src="images/telemachus/introibo.jpg"

Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: </p> <p><div class="vocab">
&mdash;Come up, <a href="#">Kinch!<span>Mulligan's nickname for Stephen, which he defines as a
"knife-blade" (the OED defines a kinch as a type of knot and I've never been able to find the word
defined as a knife, but for the purposes of the novel it makes the most sense to go with Mulligan's
definition). This nickname, which alludes to the sharpness of Stephen's intellect, is used somewhat
patronizingly -- Mulligan recognizes that Stephen has greater intellectual powers than him and is
passive-aggressively jealous, but is also aware that Stephen does not use his mind to as great a
social advantage as Mulligan does. Image from http://www.aceros-de-hispania.com/image/fallkniven-knife/idun-fallkniven-knife.jpg<br><center><img src="images/telemachus/knife.jpg"

in Ireland. The Jesuits were characterized as skilled equivocators, using craftiness to answer
unanswerable religious questions and also protecting the order during the time it was suppressed by
the Pope. Stephen has been taught by Jesuits; Mulligan fears his subtle intellect, which often
allows him to provide answers through roundabout logic (see his discussion of Hamlet, mentioned
later in this episode and explored more fully in the episode Scylla and Charybdis). Image from http://www.rowanpix.com/reenactments/images/a-Jesuit.jpg<br><center><img

middle ages. A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.</div> </p> <p><div class="vocab">
&mdash;The mockery of it! he said gaily. <a href="#">Your absurd name, an ancient
Greek!<span>Dedalus is an unusual name for an Irishman, coming from the mythical Greek Daedalus, the
great inventor who created the labyrinth for King Minos and escaped from Crete using wings he made
from birds' feathers (his son, Icarus, was given a similar set of wings for escaping, but flew so
near the sun that the wings disintegrated and he drowned). The reference to this Greek pair is
interesting, as Daedalus is often used to exemplify the rational, unemotive, scientific mind, while
Icarus represents the unrestrained artist; Stephen bears far more resemblance to the
latter. Image from http://www.joyceimages.com/media/ji/Icarus%20Dedalus.JPG<br><center><img src="images/telemachus/dedalus.JPG"

He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself. Stephen
Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching
him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks
and neck.

</p> <p> Buck Mulligan's gay voice went on. </p> <p><div class="vocab"> &mdash;My name is absurd

Mulligan, is an Anglicized Irishwoman; she looks askance at the unkempt Stephen and his family,

delight, cried: </p> <p><div class="vocab"> &mdash;Will he come? The <a

and Mulligan, apparently with the goal of researching Irish folk tradition. The previous evening he
had a nightmare involving shooting a black panther; the dream disturbed Stephen, who feared Haines
would try to shoot his gun while half-awake. This story parallels a story from Joyce's own life (see

</p> <p> Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder. </p> <p><div class="vocab">

Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner. He can't make you

his chin. </p>

<p><div class="puzzles"> &mdash;He was raving all night about a <a href="#">black

Bloom, a Jewish Dubliner, social misfit, and outcast from his own home, is often described as a sort

be discussed later in the novel; for all that Stephen feels morally superior to the British-toadying
Mulligan, he recognizes he would not have been brave enough to save the man's life.</span></a>. I'm
not a hero, however. If he stays on here I am off.</div> </p> <p> Buck Mulligan frowned at the
lather on his razorblade. He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets
hastily. </p> <p> &mdash;Scutter! he cried thickly. </p> <p> He came over to the gunrest and,
thrusting a hand into Stephen's upper pocket, said:

</p> <p> &mdash;Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor. </p> <p> Stephen suffered him to
pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the
razorblade neatly. Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: </p> <p> &mdash;The bard's noserag!
A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen. You can almost taste it, can't you? </p> <p> He
mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.

</p> <p> Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked down on the water
and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown. </p> <p> &mdash;Our mighty mother! Buck
Mulligan said. </p> <p> He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's face.
</p> <p> &mdash;The aunt thinks <a href="#">you killed your mother<span>Stephen, who recently
abandoned his previously devout Catholicism, refused to kneel down and pray with his dying mother
May (a young Joyce had done the same). He is berated both by Mulligan and his conscience, visited by
dreams and visions of a reproachful ghost</span></a>, he said. That's why she won't let me have
anything to do with you. </p> <p> &mdash;Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily. </p> <p> <div
class="vocab"> &mdash;You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you,
Buck Mulligan said. I'm <a href="#">hyperborean<span>living in or from the far north; from a

with care, in silence, seriously. </p> <p> Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned
his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve. Pain, that

death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood,

threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the <a

voice beside him. The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white
china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her
rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting. </p> <p> Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.
</p>

<p> &mdash;Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt and a few noserags.
How are the secondhand breeks? </p> <p> &mdash;They fit well enough, Stephen answered. </p> <p> Buck
Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip. </p> <p> &mdash;The mockery of it, he said
contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God knows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair
with a hair stripe, grey. You'll look spiffing in them. I'm not joking, Kinch. You look damn well
when you're dressed. </p> <p><div class="historical"> &mdash;Thanks, Stephen said. <a href="#">I

mirror. Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can't wear grey trousers.

</p> <p> He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin. </p>
<p> Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its <a href="#">smokeblue mobile
eyes<span>note this change from "grey searching eyes"; Mulligan is mercurial, willing to change any
part of himself to make the most gain</span></a>. </p> <p><div class="vocab"><div class="vocab">

swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the
sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized
all his strong wellknit trunk. </p> <p> &mdash;Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! </p>
<p>

Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack. Hair on

Stephen said. There's nothing wrong with him except at night. </p> <p> &mdash;Then what is it? Buck
Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I'm quite frank with you. What have you against me now?
</p> <p>

They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a
sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly. </p> <p> &mdash;Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.
</p> <p> &mdash;Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don't remember anything. </p> <p> He
looked in Stephen's face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed
hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes. </p> <p> Stephen, depressed by his own
voice, said: </p> <p> &mdash;Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother's
death? </p>

<p> Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: </p> <p> &mdash;What? Where? I can't remember anything.
I remember only ideas and sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God? </p> <p> &mdash;You
were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water. Your mother and
some visitor came out of the drawingroom. She asked you who was in your room. </p> <p> &mdash;Yes?
Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget. </p> <p> &mdash;You said, Stephen answered, <em>O,
it's only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead.</em> </p>

<p> A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan's cheek. </p> <p>

himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart,
said very coldly: </p> <p> &mdash;I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.

</p> <p> &mdash;Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked. </p> <p> &mdash;Of the offence to me, Stephen
answered. </p> <p> Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel. </p> <p> &mdash;O, an impossible person!
he exclaimed. </p> <p> He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post, gazing
over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew dim. Pulses were beating in his
eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks. </p> <p>

A voice within the tower called loudly: </p> <p> &mdash;Are you up there, Mulligan? </p> <p>
&mdash;I'm coming, Buck Mulligan answered. </p> <p> He turned towards Stephen and said: </p> <p><div

with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her

laughed with others when he sang: </p> <p> <br> <em>I am the boy<br> That can enjoy<br>

</p> <p> &mdash;Kinch ahoy! </p> <p> Buck Mulligan's voice sang from within the tower. It came
nearer up the staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul's cry, heard warm
running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words. </p> <p> &mdash;Dedalus, come down, like
a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is apologising for waking us last night. It's all right.
</p> <p> &mdash;I'm coming, Stephen said, turning. </p> <p> &mdash;Do, for Jesus' sake, Buck

His head disappeared and reappeared. </p> <p> &mdash;I told him <a href="#">your symbol of Irish

earlier to Haines in hope of cadging a few coins for a drink; he is willing to sell off Stephen's
art (and by extension, all Ireland) to the English for gain, if Stephen won't do it himself, but
feigns shock when Stephen later facetiously asks Haines if he can make any money off his wit
</span></a>. He says it's very clever. Touch him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean. </p> <p> <a

Lend us one. </p> <p> &mdash;If you want it, Stephen said. </p> <p> &mdash;Four shining sovereigns,
Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We'll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four
omnipotent sovereigns. </p>

<p> He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney
accent: </p> <p> <br> <em>O, won't we have a merry time,<br> Drinking whisky, beer and wine!<br> On
coronation,<br> Coronation day!<br> O, won't we have a merry time<br> On coronation day!</em> <br>

rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.</div> </p>

<p> &mdash;We'll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you? </p> <p> Stephen
laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting,
went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors. </p> <p> &mdash;Have you the <a

teaching job, he has been the one to pay the rent). He senses now the Mulligan will ask for the key,
effectively usurping his home.</span></a>? a voice asked. </p> <p> &mdash;Dedalus has it, Buck
Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I'm choked! </p> <p> He howled, without looking up from the fire: </p>
<p> &mdash;Kinch!

</p> <p> &mdash;It's in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward. </p> <p> The key scraped round
harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.
Haines stood at the doorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down
to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. Then he carried the dish and a
large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief. </p> <p> &mdash;I'm
melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch,
wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy
gifts. Where's the sugar? O, jay, there's no milk. </p> <p> Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of
honey and the buttercooler from the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet. </p> <p> <a
href="#">&mdash;What sort of a kip is this?<span>Mulligan is peeved that the milkwoman has not
appeared at the appointed time.</span></a> he said. I told her to come after eight. </p> <p>

&mdash;We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There's a lemon in the locker. </p> <p>
&mdash;O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove milk. </p> <p> Haines
came in from the doorway and said quietly: </p> <p> &mdash;That woman is coming up with the milk.
</p> <p> &mdash;The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair. Sit
down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here, I can't go fumbling at the damned eggs.
</p> <p> He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: </p>

<p><div class="vocab"> <a href="#">&mdash;<em>In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus
Sancti.</em><span>Latin Catholic blessing usually spoken while making the sign of the cross: "In the

out the tea. </p> <p> &mdash;I'm giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do
make strong tea, don't you? </p> <p> Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an
old woman's wheedling voice: </p> <p><div class="historical"><div class="vocab"> &mdash;When I makes
tea I makes tea, as old <a href="#">mother Grogan<span>A humorous Irish folkloric figure, possibly

<p>

&mdash;By Jove, it is tea, Haines said. </p> <p> Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: </p>
<p> &mdash;<em>So I do, Mrs Cahill,</em> says she. <em>Begob, ma'am,</em> says Mrs Cahill, <em>God
send you don't make them in the one pot.</em> </p> <p> He lunged towards his messmates in turn a
thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.

</p> <p> <a href="#">&mdash;That's folk<span>Haines is apparently in Ireland to collect folk tales

and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in

his brows: </p> <p><div class="vocab"> &mdash;Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan's tea and
water pot spoken of in the <a href="#">Mabinogion<span>The Mabinogion is a collection of old Welsh

Mabinogion is a collection of old Welsh story; the Upanishads are Hindu writings</span></a>?</div>
</p> <p> &mdash;I doubt it, said Stephen gravely. </p> <p> &mdash;Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in
the same tone. Your reasons, pray? </p> <p>

&mdash;I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion. Mother Grogan
was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann. </p> <p> Buck Mulligan's face smiled with delight. </p>
<p> &mdash;Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes
pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming! </p> <p> Then, suddenly overclouding all his
features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: </p> <p>
<br> <em>&mdash;For old Mary Ann<br> She doesn't care a damn.<br> But, hising up her
petticoats...</em> <br> </p> <p>

He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned. </p> <p> The doorway was darkened by an
entering form. </p> <p> &mdash;The milk, sir! </p> <p> &mdash;Come in, ma'am, Mulligan said. Kinch,
get the jug. </p> <p> An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen's elbow. </p> <p> &mdash;That's
a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God. </p>

<p> &mdash;To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure! </p> <p> Stephen reached back
and took the milkjug from the locker. </p> <p><div class="vocab"> &mdash;The islanders, Mulligan

sees the uncivilized milkwoman as personifying the Irish spirit, her very oldness and lack of
breeding suggesting she is a "messenger" or otherwise supernatural</span></a> into the measure and
thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and
a tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger. She praised the
goodness of the milk, pouring it out. Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a
witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed about her whom
they knew, dewsilky cattle. <a href="#">Silk of the kine and poor old woman<span>epithets for
Ireland</span></a>, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, <a href="#">lowly form of an

as a Goddess in disguise (just as Ireland's culture and beauty is disguised). One of Ireland's
mythic figures is Kathleen Ni Houlihan, sometimes referred to as the Poor Old Woman (as in the
Yeats/Gregory play of that name), who calls for the young men of the country to fight for Ireland's
freedom (Thornton 20).</span></a> serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common
cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. <a href="#">To serve or to upbraid<span>Seeing the
milkwoman as a mythic Kathleen-Ni-Houlihan figure protecting Ireland, Stephen wonders whether she is
there to help him in his fight against British tyranny, or to chasten him for failing Ireland.
Though initially soothed by the the site of a "real" (i.e. not Anglicized) Irish milkwoman, he
quickly sees in her the faults he sees in all the modern Irish: ignorance of national history (she
doesn't speak or even recognize Gaelic) and quickness to be impressed with foreign learning and
cultivation (e.g. Mulligan's status as a medical student).</span></a>, whether he could not tell:
but scorned to beg her favour. </div> </p> <p> &mdash;It is indeed, ma'am, Buck Mulligan said,
pouring milk into their cups. </p> <p> &mdash;Taste it, sir, she said. </p> <p> He drank at her
bidding. </p> <p> &mdash;If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we
wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap
food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives' spits. </p> <p> &mdash;Are you a
medical student, sir? the old woman asked. </p> <p>

speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: <a href="#">me she slights<span>Like
Stephen's picture of most Irish, the milkwoman is impressed with Anglicized learning but wouldn't be
impressed with the works of an Irish artist (such as Stephen hopes to be), even though artistic
abilities are closer to Ireland's cultural bequest than scientific ones</span></a>. To the voice
that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman's unclean loins, of man's
flesh made not in God's likeness, the serpent's prey. And to the loud voice that now bids her be
silent with wondering unsteady eyes.</div> </p> <p><div class="historical"> <a href="#">&mdash;Do

milkwoman, who not only does not speak irish but cannot even guess that is what he is
speaking</span></a> Stephen asked her. </div></p> <p> &mdash;Is it French you are talking, sir? the
old woman said to Haines. </p> <p> Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently. </p>

<p> &mdash;Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you? </p> <p> &mdash;I thought it was
Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the west, sir? </p> <p> &mdash;I am an Englishman,
Haines answered. </p> <p> &mdash;He's English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak
Irish in Ireland. </p> <p> &mdash;Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I'm ashamed I don't
speak the language myself. I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows. </p> <p> &mdash;Grand
is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill us out some more tea, Kinch. Would
you like a cup, ma'am?

</p> <p> &mdash;No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her
forearm and about to go. </p> <p> Haines said to her: </p> <p> &mdash;Have you your bill? We had
better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we? </p> <p> Stephen filled again the three cups. </p> <p>
&mdash;Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it's seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a
shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a
shilling. That's a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir. </p> <p>

Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides,
stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets. </p> <p> &mdash;Pay up and look
pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling. </p> <p> Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea
colouring faintly the thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his
fingers and cried: </p> <p> &mdash;A miracle! </p> <p> He passed it along the table towards the old
woman, saying: </p> <p> &mdash;Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give. </p>

<p> Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand. </p> <p> &mdash;We'll owe twopence, he said. </p> <p>
&mdash;Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning, sir. </p> <p> She
curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan's tender chant: </p> <p> <br> <em>&mdash;Heart of
my heart, were it more,<br> More would be laid at your feet.</em> <br> </p>

<p> He turned to Stephen and said: </p> <p><div class="vocab"> &mdash;Seriously, Dedalus. I'm <a

school kip and bring us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland expects that
every man this day will do his duty.</div> </p> <p> &mdash;That reminds me, Haines said, rising,
that I have to visit your national library today. </p> <p> &mdash;Our swim first, Buck Mulligan
said. </p> <p> He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: </p> <p> &mdash;Is this the day for your
monthly wash, Kinch?

</p> <p> Then he said to Haines: </p> <p> &mdash;The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a
month. </p> <p> &mdash;All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle
over a slice of the loaf. </p> <p> Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about
the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: </p> <p> &mdash;I intend to make a collection of your
sayings if you will let me. </p> <p> <div class="vocab"> Speaking to me. They wash and tub and
scrub. <a href="#">Agenbite of inwit. Conscience. Yet here's a spot.<span>"Agenbite of inwit" is
Middle English, translating to "prick of remorse". Stephen is referring sarcastically to those who
bathe more often than he does -- perhaps they are trying to whiten their unclean consciences? "Yet
here's a spot" refers to Shakespeare's Macbeth, in which the crazed Lady Macbeth (pictured) comes to
believe that she cannot wash the blood of her murders off her hands. Image from http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Ellen_Terry_at_Lady_Macbeth.jpg<br><center><img

span></a> </div></p> <p> &mdash;That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the
symbol of Irish art is deuced good. </p> <p> Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen's foot under the table and
said with warmth of tone: </p> <p> &mdash;Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines. </p> <p>
&mdash;Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just thinking of it when that
poor old creature came in. </p> <p> <a href="#">&mdash;Would I make any money by it?<span>Stephen,
who is poor but feels that his art is above being traded for money from the English, voices what
Mulligan is probably thinking (Mulligan sees his abilities -- and by extension, the abilities of the
Irish -- as fungible goods to be traded for benefits form the English)</span></a> Stephen asked.
</p>

<p> Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said: </p>
<p> &mdash;I don't know, I'm sure. </p> <p> He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent
across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour: </p> <p> &mdash;You put your hoof in it now. What did
you say that for? </p> <p> &mdash;Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From
the milkwoman or from him. It's a toss up, I think. </p> <p> &mdash;I blow him out about you, Buck
Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.

</p> <p> &mdash;I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him. </p> <p> Buck Mulligan sighed
tragically and laid his hand on Stephen's arm. </p> <p> &mdash;From me, Kinch, he said. </p> <p> In
a suddenly changed tone he added: </p> <p> &mdash;To tell you the God's truth I think you're right.
Damn all else they are good for. Why don't you play them as I do? To hell with them all. Let us get
out of the kip. </p> <p>

He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly: </p> <p>
&mdash;Mulligan is stripped of his garments. </p> <p> He emptied his pockets on to the table. </p>
<p> &mdash;There's your snotrag, he said. </p> <p> And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious
tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and rummaged
in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God, we'll simply have to dress the
character. I want puce gloves and green boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well
then, I contradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.

<p> Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the doorway: </p> <p> &mdash;Are

Mulligan asked:

<p> He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots
of ferns or grasses. </p> <p> &mdash;Down, sir! How dare you, sir! </p> <p> Haines asked: </p> <p>

<p> He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat: </p>
<p> &mdash;You couldn't manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you? </p> <p> &mdash;It has waited
so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer. </p> <p>

&mdash;You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox? </p> <p> &mdash;Pooh! Buck
Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. It's quite simple. He proves by algebra
that Hamlet's grandson is Shakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
father. </p> <p> &mdash;What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself? </p> <p> Buck
Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen's
ear: </p> <p><div class="vocab"> <a href="#">&mdash;O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of
a father!<span>Mulligan sarcastically makes a muddle of Stephen's Hamlet theory, making Haines
confused as to whether Hamlet or Stephen is referred to as the ghost of his own father. Mulligan
laughs, picturing the differences between Stephen's charismatic father and Stephen; Japhet, one of
Noah's sons, reinforces the father-son relationship motif.</span></a></div> </p> <p> &mdash;We're
always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is rather long to tell. </p>

<p> Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands. </p> <p> &mdash;The sacred pint alone
can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said. </p> <p><div class="vocab"> &mdash;I mean to say, Haines
explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of <a

an instant towards Stephen but did not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image
in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires. </p> <p> &mdash;It's a wonderful tale, Haines
said, bringing them to halt again.

</p> <p><div class="historical"><div class="vocab"> Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened,

at once put on a <a href="#">blithe broadly smiling<span>Mulligan hints at his bad side by mocking a
serious theme of the book (the father/Son relationship will be paralleled in

which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a doll's head
to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish
voice: </p> <p> <br> <em>&mdash;I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.</em><br> <a

at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: </p> <p> <br><div

quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.</div> </p>

<p> Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said: </p> <p> &mdash;We
oughtn't to laugh, I suppose. He's rather blasphemous. I'm not a believer myself, that is to say.
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn't it? What did he call it? Joseph the
Joiner? </p> <p> &mdash;The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered. </p> <p> &mdash;O, Haines
said, you have heard it before? </p> <p> &mdash;Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.
</p> <p> &mdash;You're not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in the narrow sense
of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.

</p> <p> &mdash;There's only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said. </p> <p> Haines
stopped to take out <a href="#">a smooth silver case<span>a little metaphor: Haines, the Englishman,
offers Stephen an image of Ireland (the emerald) as a decoration in England's pocket</span></a> in
which twinkled a green stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it. </p> <p> &mdash;Thank
you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette. </p> <p> Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He
put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open
too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his
hands. </p> <p> &mdash;Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or you
don't, isn't it? Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a personal God. You don't stand for
that, I suppose? </p> <p>

<a href="#">&mdash;You behold in me<span>Stephen's displeasure may be caused both by memory of his
refusal to pray with his dying mother, and by the failure of his free-willed self to be as
successful as those who serve other masters</span></a>, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a
horrible example of free thought. </p> <p><div class="vocab"> He walked on, waiting to be spoken to,

<p> Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind. </p> <p>
&mdash;After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your own master, it seems to
me. </p> <p><div class="historical"> &mdash;I am a servant of <a href="#">two masters<span>the

<p> &mdash;Italian? Haines said. </p> <p> A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me. </p>
<p> &mdash;And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs. </p> <p> &mdash;Italian?
Haines said again. What do you mean? </p> <p> &mdash;The imperial British state, Stephen answered,
his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church. </p> <p> Haines detached from
his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.

</p> <p><div class="historical"> &mdash;I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman

Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ's <a href="#">terrene<span>earthly</span></a> body, and the

They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves,
his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved
slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water. </p> <p> &mdash;Is the brother with

&mdash;Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure. </p> <p> Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly
man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones, water
glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and
spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth. </p>

himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone. </p> <p> <a

return to the tower to sleep (there is also the problem of no longer having the key); "home", now
referring to the place his immediate family lives, is also not an option -- the family has broken up
after May's death, and there is possibly some anger there over Stephen's refual to pray for
her.</span></a>. Home also I cannot go.</div> </p> <p> <a href="#">A voice<span>Mulligan's

subtly for a long time (by trying to get Stephen to sell out as he himself has done). Ulysses
parallels the problem of Penelope's suitors in the Odyssey with a series of similarly
morally-suspect usurpers: The British (usurping Ireland's culture), various men who have dubious
relationships with Leopold Bloom's wife Molly (notably, and Hugh Boylan) and Mulligan (who subtly
tries to break Stephen's determination to be a free-willed artist, and also ultimately usurps his
home). See Ellmann's biography of Joyce for parallels to Joyce's exit from the Martello
tower. Image from http://msnbcmedia3.msn.com/j/msnbc/Components/Photo_StoryLevel/080623/080623-science-odysseus-
