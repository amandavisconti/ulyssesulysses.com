<h1>Episode 2: Briefing</h1>
</p>

<p>
The second episode of <em>Ulysses</em> is usually referred to as "Nestor".
Joyce parallels the books of the <em>Odyssey</em> with the episodes of his 
novel; as the second book of the Odyssey follows Telemachus to Nestor, and old friend 
of his father who is unable to give Telemachus any news of his missing father,
the "Nestor" episode of <em>Ulysses</em> follows Stephen to his school job, 
where his supervisor, the headmaster Mr. Deasy, is unable to provide him
with any wisdom for all his advanaced age.
</p>

<p>
<span class="highlight">A Brief Episode Synopsis</span><br>
<span class="right"><img src="images/nestor/classroom.JPG" width="400" height="257"  alt="http://www.joyceimages.com/media/ji/Edwardian%20Classroom%20UK.JPG"></span>
The episode opens with Stephen teaching at his school job, perhaps a few hours
after the end of the previous episode. The episode, including the history lesson
the students are working on, reference various historical figures who
failed in trying to save their country from rule by a foreign imperial power
(e.g. the Greeks were subjugated by the Romans much as Ireland is subjugated to the British).
The students are not especially keen learners, but feel superior to Stephen
because their well-off families pay his wages.<br>
After a recitation lesson, the boys depart for field hickey. Stephen aids one of 
his students, Cyril Sargent, with an algebra lesson; although the boy is weak
and slow, Stephen realizes that his mother must love him, leading him back
to his uneasy feelings about his recently departed mother.<br>
After helping the student, Stephen visits the office of his headmaster, Mr. Deasy,
who pays him his wages while lecturing him condescendingly on the value of saving
money. Mr. Deasy is an old fogey, a diehard Britisher and spouter of tired maxims,
which is humorous in light of his Odysseyean parallel to the sage Nestor. They
match wits on several topics, including the guilt of Jewish merchants, setting
up the social atmosphere of anti-Semitism which the as-yet-unintroduced protagonist Leopold
Bloom (whose father was Jewish) must move through. Deasy
completes a letter suggesting a course of action against foot-and-mouth disease,
which he wants Stephen to share with his friends at two Dublin newspapers, and
Stephen leaves with a promise to pass the letter on.

<span class="highlight">What to Watch For</span><br>
<strong>Figures who failed to prevent national usurpation:</strong><br>
<span class="left"><img src="images/nestor/pyrrhus.jpg" width="185" height="275" alt="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Arta-Pyrrhus.jpg"></span>
<ul>
<li>The Jews: Mr. Deasy's anti-Semitism both highlights the plight of the Jewish people as wanderers in the modern world (in parallel to the irish, whose homeland has also been taken over), and sets the stage for the reader to understand the social atmosphere toward Jews in Dublin</li><br>
<li>The English attitude toward Ireland: Mr. Deasy's hyper-conservatism brings in references to the anti-British violence in Ireland's history</li><br>
<li>The Greeks and Romans: Pyrrhus (statue at left) and Cassandra both failed to prevent their country's takeover by the Romans</li><br>
<li>Ancient Irish: Saint Columbanus ineffectually pled the cause of the ancient Irish Church to the Europeans (Blamires 11)</li>
</ul>

<strong>An ironic parallel to the Odyssey:</strong> This episode parallels the part in the <em>Odyssey</em> when the young Telemachus goes to seek news of his missing father from the aged Nestor. Ironically, the "Nestor" here, Mr. Deasy, embodies everything Stephen is rebelling against and offers him tired cliches and no wisdom.
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Amor matris</em> -- a mother's love:</strong>:  Stephen's uneasiness about his treatment of his recently deceased mother is referenced both in his musings on the weak student Sargent (who must have a mother who loves him), and the riddle he gives his students (which references a recent burial, a cunning fox [Stephen], and a dead [grand]mother).
</p>

<p>
<span class="highlight">Main Characters</span><br>
<strong>Stephen Dedalus:</strong> Stephen, the young, intelligent man introduced
in the previous section. Stephen has a teaching position, which he resents
for turning him into a "servant" of another man (and a very English one at that).<br><br>
<strong>Mr. Deasy:</strong> Stephen's supervisor and the school's headmaster. An
old conservative, somewhat anti-Semitic,  and quite pro-British;
fond of trite and empty maxims.
</p>

<p>
<span class="highlight">Setting</span><br>
This episode opens shortly after the end of the previous episode, on the same morning. 
Stephen has gone to his "school kip" and is engaged in teaching his class.
